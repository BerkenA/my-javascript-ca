Rainydays Javascript CA:
  	Rainydays CA. Rainydays CA is my course assignment in the JavaScript course at Noroff Education.
    We were asked to create a simple ecommerce website by accessing all the product data from a given API.
  	The user will find all products on the main page, where they can filter the jacket.
  	They get more details by clicking in on any jacket and have the possibility to add it to their cart and from there order it and checkout.
  	In this project the focus is on JavaScript and therefore the HTML and CSS has not been prioritized.

Installation
  To access my project you need to have a code editor. I use Visual Studio code and a live server so you can acces to page.

Pages and usage.
  My project has 4 pages. Index (Main page) with all the jackets.
  A product specific page where you get all the specific information available in the API displayed to the user and the posibility to add the items to the cart.
  A cart page where the user sees all of the jackets that they have addet to the cart. Here they can either confirm their order or remove jackets from the cart. 
  All data displayed is fetched from the API.
